I'm a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, interested in
solving theoretical and computational problems in cosmology. I earned my BA and
MSci degrees from the University of Cambridge, where I studied theoretical and
experimental physics.

My research interests included numerical methods for the fast solution of
ordinary differential equations with highly oscillatory solutions; vacua in
curved, expanding spacetimes; and applying machine learning tools to forecast
sea ice loss in the Arctic.

On these pages you'll find:

- a summary of the [research projects]({% link research.md %}) I've been
  involved in
- a list of my [publications and posters]({% link pubs-posters.md %})
- my [cv]({% link cv.md %})
- upcoming and past [events]({% link events.md %}) I attended
- and finally some thoughts on research, coding practices, etc. in the form of a
  **blog** below!
