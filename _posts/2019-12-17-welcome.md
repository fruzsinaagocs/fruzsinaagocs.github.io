I'm a research fellow at the Center for Computational Mathematics within the Flatiron Insitute, working in the numerical analysis group lead by Alex Barnett. My research interests can be broadly summarised as efficient numerical methods for oscillatory differential equations, with a focus on applications in physics (mostly astrophysics and quantum mechanics). 

Previously I've studied at the University of Cambridge, UK, where I earned my PhD in theoretical cosmology and MSci + BA in physics.

On these pages you'll find:

- a summary of the [research projects]({% link research.md %}) I've been
  involved in
- a list of my [publications and posters]({% link pubs-posters.md %})
- my [cv]({% link cv.md %})
- upcoming and past [events]({% link events.md %}) I attended
- and finally some thoughts on research, coding practices, etc. in the form of a
  **blog** below!
